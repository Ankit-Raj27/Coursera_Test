<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. This is link to facebook <a href="www.facebook.com"> www.facebook.com</a> Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph</p>
<p class="style"> This is the para that will get styled </p>
