<h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<p>
	There is an area of the Pacific Ocean where garbage, primarily plastics, collects; it’s known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch or the Pacific Trash Vortex. This patch is a collection of marine debris that spans the waters from the U.S. western coast all the way to Japan. Most of the debris is plastic because plastic is not biodegradable and is found in most consumer and industrial products.</p>
	<h2>Subheading 2</h2>

<p>Once it’s out in the ocean, plastic gets broken down by the sun and becomes ‘microplastics’ – particles of which are so small that they can’t be seen with the naked eye. All of this plastic and other debris is moved by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a circular motion of four currents, and deposited into a convergence zone where warm waters meet cooler waters. Since the center of the gyre is mostly calm, the debris ends up in the middle and stays there. The pollutants are devastating to marine life.

About 750,000 pieces of debris have been picked up in one square kilometer by scientists examining the Patch. No nation will take responsibility or provide funding for clean up efforts since the vortex is so far off the coast, and no single nation could feasibly fund a cleanup project of this magnitude. </p>
